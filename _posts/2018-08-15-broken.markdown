Shattered glass.<br/>
Dried blood across the floor.

Silence.

Lost in the dark, fragile, labored breath.<br/>
Light. Can remember the light.<br/>
Warmth too.<br/>
There was warmth once.

Deep sigh.<br/>
There's life still.<br/>
And maybe, just maybe, some hope to be found beyond that cold, dark ocean of despair.

If only there was some strength left. For just one more step.<br/>
But need to get up first.

Up is scary. Up implies falling back down.
