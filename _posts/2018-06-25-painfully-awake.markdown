Whenever I close my eyes, it's your body I see.<br/>
At the lightest touch, my skin calls for yours.<br/>
The spark in your eyes, the smile on your face,<br/>
The echo of your breathing, tense and speeding up...

It all boils in my veins, burns me from the inside out.<br/>
However similar they might sound, patience and passion,<br/>
Are nothing alike, always at odds in the loudest fury.<br/>
Their struggle drowns my thoughts, deafening and frightening.<br/>
This tumultuous and dreaded storm rage within me.<br/>
Waiting to feel your touch slows time to a crawl.<br/>
Every minute that goes by feel like I've aged a whole year.<br/>
Every breath I take taxes my strength, and hurts so much.

There is no relief, no hope, no salvation from this pain.<br/>
Each heartbeat feels strained, unnatural and unsure.

Until I'm in your arms again, until I can hold you in mine,<br/>
Then the world collapses, crumbles disappears under my feet...<br/>
And all that is left, all that truly matters is you.<br/>
Light, laughter, joy, warmth and the smell of hope;<br/>
The taste of happiness, of pleasure given and shared,<br/>
It all overcomes me and makes everything right again.

But until then, my darling, my compass and my love,<br/>
I shall be waiting, longing for your sweet embrace.
