I shy away from facing my sadness,<br/>
With beer and tears for only company<br/>
My thoughts lost in familiar darkness,<br/>
And the sharp pain of my agony

Writing these lines to keep my mind at bay<br/>
Trying to cope with the unbearable pain<br/>
Of that dreadful day when you passed away<br/>
Unborn you were, and will ever so remain

No amount of crying will bring you back<br/>
I've tried though, and the clouds are beat<br/>
My tears have won; rain admits it's defeat

My heart moans, bursts and turns black<br/>
Anger and grief live side by side<br/>
And I know not where to hide
