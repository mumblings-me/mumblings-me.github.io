Guilt. Guilt everywhere.<br/>
Yours, mine, ours.<br/>
Your quiet acceptance despite your pain, despite your unease.<br/>
Opening yourself to me, offering up your body, as if it were your duty.<br/>
For years, there have been times where your ignored yourself,<br/>
Where you put yourself time and time again through the abuse<br/>
You experienced as a child.

You couldn't say no, or if you did, you felt guilt.<br/>
Thus you opened your legs and suffered through it.<br/>
You let me in and smiled, but it killed you breath after breath.<br/>
Sure, you enjoyed it sometimes. Maybe. Hopefully...

Then, then... suppressed memories started coming back.<br/>
As untrusted feelings first, then more accurate, more certain,<br/>
And you slowly realized. Slowly made sense of it.<br/>
And told me.

Told me I'd been unknowingly raping you for years.<br/>
That yes meant no, except some times.<br/>
That my best memories of us sharing intimacy were mine alone,<br/>
That you weren't really there for them.

Of course, those weren't your words.<br/>
You said you had been afraid of losing me if you said no,<br/>
Afraid of hurting me, of causing me pain and frustration.<br/>
You said it was your fault, and I couldn't know...

Yet guilt, shame and the fear of losing you, losing your love<br/>
Haven't given me an instant of respite since that day.<br/>
I **should** have known.<br/>
I love you deeply, I care, I am not blind, how *could* I not see?

Unless part of me didn't want to.<br/>
Unless part of me abused you.<br/>
Unless part of me raped you.<br/>
Unless part of me deserves to die in a fire.

But part of me is so angry at you.<br/>
For not saying no back then.<br/>
For letting me hurt you.<br/>
For letting me be all that I hate.
